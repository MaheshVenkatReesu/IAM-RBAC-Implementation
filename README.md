# IAM & RBAC Implementation in AWS

## üìå Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to implement IAM Policies & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in AWS, ensuring least privilege access, security best practices, and automation. It showcases the process of defining roles, creating custom policies, and enforcing MFA and logging for enhanced security.

## üîπ Key Features  
‚úÖ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): IAM roles for Admins, Developers, and Auditors with permissions tailored for each group.  
‚úÖ Custom IAM Policies: Fine-grained JSON-based policies for controlling access to AWS services and resources.  
‚úÖ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforced for privileged roles to add an additional layer of security.  
‚úÖ Logging & Monitoring: AWS CloudTrail enabled to monitor and log user activities.  
‚úÖ Automation (Optional): Terraform scripts to automate IAM role and policy creation.

## üìÇ Project Structure  
- iam_policies/ ‚Üí Contains JSON files for custom IAM policies.  
- terraform_scripts/ ‚Üí Contains Terraform scripts for automating IAM setup (optional).  
- architecture_diagram.png ‚Üí Visual representation of the RBAC model and access control flow.  
- security_audit_report.md ‚Üí Document detailing the IAM security audit, findings, and recommendations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create IAM roles & policies:  
   - Use AWS IAM console or Terraform to define roles for Admins, Developers, and Auditors.  
   - Attach specific IAM policies based on the principle of least privilege.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Enforce MFA & CloudTrail logging:  
   - Enforce MFA for all privileged accounts to enhance security.  
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing and logging all user actions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Define Custom Policies:  
   - Create fine-grained IAM policies that restrict permissions based on the user‚Äôs role.  
   - Use policy variables to dynamically assign permissions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Conduct IAM Security Audit:  
   - Use IAM tools like IAM Access Analyzer and AWS Config to assess security posture.  
   - Document findings in the security_audit_report.md and suggest improvements.

## üöÄ Automation (Optional)  
- Terraform scripts can be used to automate IAM role and policy creation, ensuring consistency and scalability.

### Terraform Script Example:
```terraform
resource "aws_iam_role" "developer_role" {
  name               = "developer_role"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role_policy.json
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "developer_policy" {
  name        = "developer_policy"
  description = "Custom IAM policy for developer role"
  policy      = data.aws_iam_policy_document.developer_policy.json
}
